Hello! I’m Daniel Grzenda, a third-year PhD candidate in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.uchicago.edu/) 
at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en). I’m a member of [Globus Labs](https://labs.globus.org),
working under the guidance of [Ian Foster](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/ian-foster/) and 
[Kyle Chard](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/kyle-chard/). My research interests span 
distributed computing, high-performance MLOps, and advanced AI techniques—particularly
graph neural networks—and I’m passionate about making large-scale systems more accessible, efficient, and intelligent.


On this blog, I share my perspectives on a wide range of technology topics—everything from building development 
environments and architecting systems for large-scale computing, to advances in AI and graph neural networks. 
I’m also interested in the business side of technology, as I believe it offers valuable insights into its trajectory and impact.
